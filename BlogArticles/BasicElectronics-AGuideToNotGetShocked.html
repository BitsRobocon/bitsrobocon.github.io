                <p>
                    Welcome back!<br>
                    In this blog, we go back to the basics and try to understand the basic electronic components used in robots. It is going
                    to be quite simple to understand and is one of the first things you’ll do (or would have done) when starting to work
                    with electronics. We’ll look at a lot of components, but not go into too much depth about each of them.
                    And please forgive us if it gives you PTSD from your JEE times.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Before jumping to learn about different electronic components, let’s see how the electronic components are categorized :
                </p>
                
                <h2>Passive Circuit Components</h2>

                <p>
                    A passive component is an electronic component which can only receive energy, which it can either dissipate, absorb or
                    store in an electric field or a magnetic field. Passive elements do not need any form of electrical power to <br>
                    As the name ‘passive’ suggests – passive devices do not provide gain or amplification. Passive components cannot
                    amplify, oscillate, or generate an electrical signal.
                </p>

                <h2>Active Circuit Components</h2>

                <p>
                    An active component is an electronic component which supplies energy to a circuit.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <em>As you go along, try to figure out which are passive and which are active components.</em>
                </p>

                <h1>Basic Electronic Components</h1>

                <h2>Resistor</h2>

                <p>
                    Ah yes, the resistor. Hasn’t this simple component appeared everywhere since class 10? This little <em>(literally, it is
                    quite small)</em> troublemaker is a two terminal electronic component that limits or regulates the current in a circuit. They
                    can also be used to provide a specific voltage for an active component such as a transistor.
                </p>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/First_Image.jpg" alt=""> 
                
                <p>
                    There are two types of resistors - fixed-type resistors and variable resistance resistors.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fixed-type</strong> resistors are generally used to limit current and voltage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Vaariable-resistors</strong> are generally used to regulate current and voltage.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Apart from these applications, resistors may also be used in certain contexts where it is necessary to dissipate power
                    or drop voltage as desired by different components in the circuit.
                </p>

                <h2>Photo-resistor (Light Dependent Resistor (LDR))</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Second_Image.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    A photo-resistor or Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) or photocell is a <strong>resistor whose resistance decreases with increasing
                    incident light intensity</strong>. In the dark, a photoresistor can have a resistance as high as several megaohms (MΩ), while in
                    the light, a photoresistor can have a resistance as low as a few hundred ohms.
                </p>

                <p>
                    This certainly looks like magic worthy of Hermione Granger herself, how can we control resistance with available light
                    intensity?
                </p>

                <p>
                    If incident light on a photoresistor exceeds a certain frequency, photons absorbed by the semiconductor give bound
                    electrons enough energy to jump into the conduction band. The resulting free electrons (and their hole partners) conduct
                    electricity, thereby lowering resistance.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These are used in street lamps, to turn on the light only in the evenings (power conservation ftw).
                </p>

                <h2>Capacitor</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Third_Image.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    A capacitor is a device for storing electronic charge. It is basically a bank for charge, when it is suddenly asked to
                    take a load of current, it refuses. And when there is sudden reduction in charge, it loans the circuit some charge. It
                    consists of a pair of conductors separated by an insulator. There are two types of capacitors - <strong>non-polarized (ceramic)</strong>
                    capacitors and <strong>polarized (electrolytic)</strong> capacitors. Capacitors can be used to block DC voltage, adjust the frequency of
                    an oscillator, generate a time-delay in a circuit, smoothen a DC voltage, etc.
                </p>

                <h2>Diode</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Diode.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    A diode is an electronic component that permits the flow of current in one direction. It can be used in <strong>rectification</strong>,
                    i.e., conversion of AC to DC. It can also be used in protection circuits which protect a device from back-emf.
                </p>

                <p>
                    They can be used in wave-shaping circuits. We look at two special classes of diodes in greater detail - Light Emitting
                    Diodes (LED) and Photodiodes.
                </p>

                <h2>LED</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Fourth_Image.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    Undoubtedly, LEDs are one of the most used components among electronics. Whether it be a TV remote or fairy lights on
                    Diwali, virtually nothing can be imagined without the use of LEDs.
                </p>

                <p>
                    An LED works in <strong>forward bias</strong>, i.e., when the positive terminal of the diode is at a higher electric potential than the
                    negative terminal of the diode. It emits light when connected in a circuit. Note that the shorter lead of the LED is the
                    negative terminal, and the longer lead is the positive terminal. Because we need negativity and more positivity in our
                    lives (<em>sorry for the cheesy philosophy. Maybe we should take the Intro to Philosophy course,huh?</em>) Also, when seen from
                    top, near the negative terminal, the dome of the LED is flat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The LEDs usually are made to emit single colour, but there are LEDs which can emit multiple colours just by adding a
                    third pin, where we can supply a PWM signal, and LED will throw a corresponding colour.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Controlling the Brightness of LEDs is again quite simple. If the blink program is “Hello World” of Arduino, by the same
                    analogy, controlling the brightness of LED is as simple as adding two numbers. As you might expect, you just need to
                    send a PWM signal to the HIGH pin of LED and Voila! You have the brightness under control.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact</strong> : Three scientists have jointly earned the 2014 Nobel Prize in physics for their work on blue LEDs, or
                    light-emitting diodes. Why blue in particular? Well, blue was the last - and most difficult - advance required to create
                    white LED light. And with white LED light, companies are able to create smartphone and computer screens, as well as
                    light bulbs that last longer and use less electricity than any bulb invented before.
                </p>

                <h2>Photodiode (Photo Detector)</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Fifth_Image.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    The above image shows a photodetector used in CD ROM drives.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A photodiode operates in <strong>reverse bias</strong>, i.e., when the negative terminal of the diode is at a higher electric potential
                    than the positive terminal of the diode. When light falls on the PN-junction of the photodiode, it creates an electron
                    hole pair in the depletion layer which causes flow of current. If all this seems Greek-and-Latin to you, you could just
                    remember when light falls on a photodiode, current flows through it. The magnitude of this current depends on the
                    intensity of the light that is incident on the photodiode.
                </p>

                <h2>Transistor</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Sixth_Image.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify and switch between multiple electronic signals. A transistor has
                    three terminals, where one terminal can be used to control the flow of current through the other two terminals. There
                    are two types of transistors viz., junction transistors and field-effect transistors. There are two types of <strong>junction</strong>
                    transistors - <strong>n-p-n</strong> and <strong>p-n-p</strong>.
                </p>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Seventh_Image.png" alt="">

                <p>
                    Transistors are used as switches, as amplifiers and in the realization of logic gates.
                    Can you guess whether this is an active or passive source. This might not be obvious as a current or voltage source –
                    transistors are also an active circuit component. This is because transistors are able to amplify the power of a signal.
                </p>

                <h2>Logic Gates</h2>

                <p>
                    As we read in the Physics textbooks of Senior Secondary, a logic gate is an idealized or physical device implementing a
                    Boolean function, that is, it performs a logical operation on one or more logical inputs, and produces a single logical
                    output. Logic gates are primarily implemented in real life, using diodes or transistors acting as electronic switches.
                    The most common logic gates are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR and XNOR. Each of these is a gate-keeper and if you want to
                    enter the pearly gates of heaven, you’ll have to have certain qualities(<em>more philosophy, or is it Bhagwad Gita this
                    time?</em>)
                </p>

                <p>
                    The output of Logic Gates wrt the inputs can be calculated by the following “truth-table”
                </p>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Eighth_Image.jpg" alt="">

                <h2>Potentiometer</h2>

                <p>
                    Hmm sounds like something to measure some potential. Well you are somewhat correct. It is essentially a voltage divider
                    used for measuring electric potential (voltage); the component is an implementation of the same principle, hence its
                    name. A potentiometer is a three-terminal resistor with a sliding or rotating contact that forms an adjustable voltage
                    divider. If only two terminals are used, one end and the wiper, it acts as a variable resistor or rheostat.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You have been using potentiometers (unknowingly) in day to day life. For example, the speaker knobs in to control the
                    volume or change the file, also some servos have it to measure the correct angle movements.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A potentiometer returns an analog value to the arduino and can be used to control servo movement, brightness of an led
                    and many more things.
                </p>

                <h2>LCD</h2>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/LCD.jpg" alt="">

                <p>
                    These are one of the most widely used LCD displays for Arduino projects. They can display alphanumeric characters and
                    contain 2 rows of 16 characters each
                </p>

                <p>
                    The actual method of sending data to this LCD to display is detailed and cumbersome, mostly in the realm of advanced
                    microcontroller programming. However, the LiquidCrystal library lets you display messages in only a couple of lines.
                </p>

                <p>
                    What is a library?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Libraries in general (technical sense) are a collection of objects that can be incorporated into your code whenever
                    required. The Arduino has various libraries built for different components that you might need while designing a
                    circuit. Whenever you need to use a component or a function related to that, you need to use the parent library. The
                    TinkerCAD circuit simulator has a limited list of libraries for components like the LCD, IR remote, Servo motor etc.
                </p>

                <p>
                    How to include library in tinkercad :
                </p>

                <p>
                    Luckily, tinkercad has a very simple user interface and you don’t need to go through much hassle to use a library. To
                    import a library:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Click on the libraries button on the upper right corner of your code editor:</li>
                    <li>Browse list of available libraries, click on LiquidCrystal. This is the name of the library meant for our LCD display.</li>
                    <li>Click on the include button to the left of the library's name in the search menu to import the library into your code.</li>
                    <li>You may also import a library by adding a​ #include <libraryname.h>​ to the top of your code.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    Hello World, on an LCD
                </p>

                <h2>Heat Sink</h2>

                <p>
                    This is the same thing we used to learn in thermodynamics class. It is a passive heat exchanger that transfers the heat
                    generated by an electronic or a mechanical device to a fluid medium, often air or a liquid coolant, where it is
                    dissipated away from the device, thereby allowing regulation of the device's temperature. In computers, heat sinks are
                    used to cool CPUs, GPUs, and some chipsets and RAM modules. Heat sinks are used with high-power semiconductor devices
                    such as power transistors and optoelectronics such as lasers and light emitting diodes (LEDs), where the heat
                    dissipation ability of the component itself is insufficient to moderate its temperature.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A heat sink is designed to maximize its surface area in contact with the cooling medium surrounding it, such as the air.
                    Air velocity, choice of material, protrusion design and surface treatment are factors that affect the performance of a
                    heat sink. Heat sink attachment methods and thermal interface materials also affect the die temperature of the
                    integrated circuit. Thermal adhesive or grease improve the heat sink's performance by filling air gaps between the heat
                    sink and the heat spreader on the device. A heat sink is usually made out of aluminium or copper.

                <h2>Buzzers</h2>

                <p>
                    A buzzer or beeper is an audio signalling device, which may be mechanical, electromechanical, or piezoelectric (piezo
                    for short). Typical uses of buzzers and beepers include alarms, timers, and confirmation of user input such as a mouse
                    click or keystroke.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> in an arduino we can add the frequencies for the buzzer to emit and hence create different notes. Here is an example for
                    the same.

                <h2>Fuses</h2>

                <p>
                    A fuse is an electrical safety device that operates to provide overcurrent protection of an electrical circuit. Its
                    essential component is a metal wire or strip that melts when too much current flows through it, thereby stopping or
                    interrupting the current. It is a sacrificial device; once a fuse has operated it is an open circuit, it must be
                    replaced or rewired, depending on type.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Different fuse designs have different current and voltage ratings, breaking capacity and response times. The time and
                    current operating characteristics of fuses are chosen to provide adequate protection without needless interruption.
                    Wiring regulations usually define a maximum fuse current rating for particular circuits. Short circuits, overloading,
                    mismatched loads, or device failure are some of the reasons for fuse operation.

                <h2>BreadBoards - The way to prototype electronic circuits</h2>

                <img src="" alt="">

                <h3>Intrduction</h3>

                <p>
                    So, as we have learnt about the various basic electronic components, it's time to see how to implement them in real
                    projects.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The initial implementations of any idea are always prone to errors like wrong/misplaced connections, bad components,
                    unexpected results due to noise and many other minor optimizations and improvements. And you wouldn’t want to ruin your
                    soon-to-be amazing project due to an avoidable mistake, would you? So, you create an electronic guinea pig, a prototype,
                    before doing anything permanent (<em>no, we do not promote animal testing. This was just an example, please don’t sue us</em>)
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <strong>breadboard</strong> is one such thing that is used to <strong>build and test circuits quickly before finalizing</strong> any circuit design. It
                    has many holes into which circuit components like ICs (Integrated Circuits) and resistors can be inserted. It also has
                    strips of metal which run underneath the board and connect the holes on the top of the board. The metal strips are laid
                    out as shown below.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Note that the left and right column of holes are connected vertically while the remaining holes are connected
                    horizontally (<em>yes, this confused us all in the beginning</em>).
                </p>

                <img src="../content/BlogImages/BasicElectronics-AGuideToNotGetShocked/Thirteenth_Image.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    To use a breadboard, the legs of components are placed in the holes. Each set of holes connected by a metal strip
                    underneath forms a node. A <strong>node</strong> is a point in a circuit where two components are connected. Connections between
                    different components are formed by putting their legs in a common node. The long left and right columns of holes are
                    usually used for power supply connections. The rest of the circuit is built by placing components and connecting them
                    together with jumper wires. ICs are placed in the middle of the board so that half of the legs are on one side of the
                    middle line and half on the other.

                <h3>Breadboarding Tips</h3>

                <p>
                    It is important to breadboard a circuit neatly and systematically, so that one can debug it and get it running easily
                    and quickly.
                    It also helps when someone else needs to understand and inspect the circuit. Here are some tips that might help you in
                    future.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Always use the side-lines for power supply connections. Power the chips from the sidelines and not directly from the
                    power supply.</li>
                    
                    <li>Use black wires for ground connections (0 V), and red for other power connections. Easy to remember this - red equals
                    danger and black, well, it looks good with red</li>
                    
                    <li>Keep the jumper wires on the board flat, so that the board does not look cluttered (<em>this isn’t your hostel room</em>)</li>
                    
                    <li>Route jumper wires around the chips and not over the chips. This makes changing the chips when needed easier.</li>
                    
                    <li>You could trim the legs of components like resistors, transistors and LEDs, so that they fit in snugly and do not get
                    pulled out by accident.</li>
                </ul>
